  <p><strong>25.08.2025: Book 2 and audiobook!</strong> <br>
    Hi! Short update form me, the creator here. Book 2 is about half way done before its off to be grammar-checked and all that. I hope to have it out for sale before Christmas 2026, but this is a rough estimate on my part.
    I'm also planning on  getting an audiobook out for the first book, but i want it to be professional and well made, so i will ned to hire inn someone good to do it. That means money, and that means i need to save up some first before the work can begin. So it will come at some point, it will just take some time to make it happen.</p>
