    <h2>🌿 Humans</h2>
    <p>Humans are race that can be found most places in the world of Vanum, from the cold north, to the sandy dunes of the golden sea.
      After the first emperor united most human kingdoms under one faction, they also became the most dominant species in this world.
      The empire itself runs a humanity first policy, but there are other human factions that are more openminded, such as the borderkingdoms south of the empire, or the Mercenary kingdom to the east.

    <h2>⛏️ Dwarves</h2>
    <p>Dwarfs are a strong and sturdy folk, though short of stature. They are physically stronger than humans, and have a tendancy to have a closer connecting to the elements of Fire and earth.
      The dwarfs mainly lives under ground and in mountains, though they can also be found traveling the lands and offering their services to all races.
      The race is also known for their excelent craftmanship, which many dwarf holds have grown rich from pursuing.
      The dwarven race was the one most devistated during the rise of the emperor however, as they are the race that put up most of a fight, leading to the worlds dwarf population declining siginificantly and them loosing many of their holds to the surging human faction.

  <div id="terrors" class="tab-content">
    <h2>🔥 The Terrors</h2>

    <h2>🔥 Elves</h2>
    <p>Elves are a faction with strong ties to magic, especially air and water magic.
      They are long lived, and have been known to live up towards three thousand years.
    During the rise of the empire they were blamed for many of the woes of human kind, and they quickly retreated to the west after loosing a single battle against the surging human empire.
  Elves are physically weak of body, but strong in magic, and they much prefere diplomacy over warfare.</p>
